## User experience (UX)

Rock Paper Scissors is a game to play for fun, or to use for making decisions.  

### User stories

#### User goals
Make visitors play a fun game.


## Design

I aimed for a clean design with earthy colors. 

### Colour Scheme

![color scheme](.png)

The color palette was created using [Colorminds](http://colormind.io/)


### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used. 

I went for Bungee cause it fits in well with the colors and look I wanted. 

### Imagery

I created the icons with the colors in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

### Wireframes

For this simple wireframe I used [mockflow.com](https://wwww.mockflow.com)

## Features

Rock Paper Scissors is a game with only one page.
