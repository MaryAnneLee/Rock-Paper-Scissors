## Design

I aimed for a clean design with earthy colors. 

### Colour Scheme

![color scheme](assets/images/readme/rps-color-palette.png)

The color palette was created using [Colorminds](http://colormind.io/)


### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used. 

I went for Bungee cause it fits in well with the colors and look I wanted. 

### Imagery

I add colors to the button icons in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

### Wireframes

For this simple wireframe I used pen and paper.

## Features

Rock Paper Scissors is a game with only one page divided in three sections.

* Header with the title of the game. Background color blends in well with the rest of the page.

### Solved bugs

1.  Did not get the JavaScript to work so that it did the task to show what beats what. 
Solution: After trying to get it to work several times I started over from the beginning with JS with a differant tutorial. The second tutorial was much easier to understand and the problem was solved when starting over with new JavaScript. 

2. Image icons didn´t stay in the browser window on smaller screens. 
Solution: Googled it [javapoint.com](https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-change-image-size-in-css) had an explanation for it, and I added max-width and height to the images. 

3. An 404 error message appeared on Dev tools, regarding favicon.
Solution: Searched on Slack and found out that the sultion was to add a favicon, so I did and the error message disappeared.
